<h1><u>Into the Life of Ancin</u></h1>

<center><img src="HW-Image.jpg"></center>

  <p>Welcome to the homepage of <span><b>Ancin White!</b></span> Here, you will learn about my interest & goals in life. </p>

 <h3><a href="mobile-friendly-HW-AW.html">Interests</a></h3>
   <ul>
  	<li>Music [such as hip hop, jazz, R&B, electronic, etc.</li>
  	<li>Art [such as graphic design, abstract, photography, etc.</li>
   </ul>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
   <ul>
  	 <li>Become a web developer</li>
  	 <li> I've wanted to go this route recently after realizing that, after playing around with code during my early teenage years, i.e. the "MySpace Days," it was one of the few things that I've enjoyed the most.</li>
  	 <li>Become a music supervisor for film, television & video games</li>
  	 <li> I've always had an interest with both movies & music since I was a kid. The most interesting & important aspect of a film to me is how music, whether intrumentally or fully composed with lyrics, can correlate with scenes within a movie.</li>
  	 <li>Become an art collector</li>
   </ul>
